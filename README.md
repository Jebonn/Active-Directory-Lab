# Active Directory Lab
## Introduction
### Objective
This lab's goal is become acquainted with virtual machines, active directory, and group policy concepts. To reach that goal, an isolated virtual network environment will be set up using VMWare's hypervisor and it will be used to simulate a small network that uses Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). Sample user accounts will be created and then logically grouped under Organizational Units (OUs). Finally, the sample accounts will have various settings configured by applying Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to the OUs.
